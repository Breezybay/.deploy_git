<h3 id="What-is-this-book-about"><a href="#What-is-this-book-about" class="headerlink" title="What is this book about"></a>What is this book about</h3><p>The focus of a game designer is designing <strong>game play</strong>, conceiving and designing rules and structure that result in an experience for players.</p>
<p><strong>Schemas</strong>: Rules, Play, Culture</p>
<h3 id="The-Design-Process"><a href="#The-Design-Process" class="headerlink" title="The Design Process"></a>The Design Process</h3><h4 id="Iterative-Design"><a href="#Iterative-Design" class="headerlink" title="Iterative Design"></a>Iterative Design</h4><p>Iterative design is a play-based design process…In an iterative methodology, a rough version of the game is rapidly prototyped as early in the design process as possible. This prototype has none of the aesthetic trappings of the final game, but begins to define its fundamental rules and core mechanics. It is not a visual prototype, but an interactive one.<br>Iterative design is a cyclic process that alternates between prototyping, playtesting, evaluation, and refinement</p>
<p>…it is not possible to fully anticipate play in advance. It is never possible to completely predict the experience of a game…These questions can never be answered by writing a design document or crafting a set of game rules and materials. They can only be answered by way of play.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb regarding prototyping: a game prototype should be created and playtested, at the absolute latest, 20 percent of the way into a project schedule.</p>
<p>Prototype your game early. Play it throughtout the entire design process. Have as many other people as you possibly can play your game, and observe them playing.</p>
<h4 id="Playtesting"><a href="#Playtesting" class="headerlink" title="Playtesting"></a>Playtesting</h4><p>My primary design technique is to create a game first in my mind and play it there over and over again. This can go on for many weeks. When I feed the need for practical playing experience, I finally build the first prototype and play it with my playtest groups.</p>
<p>Once the initial concept is properly elaborated, playtesting becomes the core activity of game development.<br>The fun and excitement of playing cannot be calculated in an abstract fashion: it must be experienced.<br>I prepare each of my playtest sessions in great detail — I plan the exact issues I want to monitor and test. During play, I record relevant data about the game flow. Afterwards, I analyze the results and then make necessary or exploratory changes.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is only one path to becoming a game designer, and that is the path of designing games — and more to the point, designing games that people really like.<br>That means that simply jotting down your game idea isn’t enough. You must build the game, play it yourself, and let others play it.<br>When it doesn’t satisfy (and it won’t), you must change it. And change it. And change it again, dozens of times, until you have created a game that people actually enjoy playing.<br>When you have been through this a few times, then you will start to understand what game design is.<br>There’s an saying among game designers: “Your first ten games will suck — so get them out of the way fast.”</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #1: The Lens of Emotion<br>People may forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel. —Maya Angelou<br>● What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why?<br>● What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?<br>● How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions I’d like them to have?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #2: The Lens of Essential Experience<br>● What experience do I want the player to have?<br>● What is essential to that experience?<br>● How can my game capture that essence?</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="Venue"><a href="#Venue" class="headerlink" title="Venue"></a>Venue</h5><p>It takes a bit of a mental shift to look past the technologies we use and instead to see the patterns of how we use them</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #3: The Lens of the Venue<br>The places that we play exert tremendous influence on the design of our games.<br>To make sure you aren’t designing in a vacuum, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What type of venue best suits the game I’m trying to create?<br>● Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?<br>● What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="What-is-a-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Game"></a>What is a Game</h5><p><strong>Fun is pleasure with surprises</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #4: The Lens of Surprise<br>Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What will surprise players when they play my game?<br>● Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?<br>● Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?<br>● Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?<br>Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises.<br>In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays considered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered.<br>In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #5: The Lens of Fun<br>To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What parts of my game are fun? Why?<br>● What parts need to be more fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Work and play … become equivalent to servitude and freedom.</strong><br><strong>Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #6: The Lens of Curiosity<br>To use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals.<br>● What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?<br>● What am I doing to make them care about these questions?<br>● What can I do to make them invent even more questions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[A game is] an interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires players to struggle toward a goal.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #7: The Lens of Endogenous Value<br>To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What is valuable to the players in my game?<br>● How can I make it more valuable to them?<br>● What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?<br>Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game.<br>By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict, and resolves in an unequal outcome.<br>– Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman</p>
<p>Q1. Games are entered willfully.<br>Q2. Games have goals.<br>Q3. Games have conflict.<br>Q4. Games have rules.<br>Q5. Games can be won and lost.<br>Q6. Games are interactive.<br>Q7. Games have challenge.<br>Q8. Games can create their own internal value.<br>Q9. Games engage players.<br>Q10. Games are closed, formal systems.</p>
<p>“I like playing with my friends” “I like the physical activity” “I like feeing immersed in another world” “<strong>I like solving problems.</strong>“<br>The enjoyment of problem solving seems to be an evolved survival mechanism.</p>
<p>One of the first things we do is to state the problem we are trying to solve, that is, define a clear goal (Q2). Next, we frame the problem. We determine its boundaries and the nature of the problem space. We also determine what methods we are allowed to use to solve the problem; that is, we determine the rules of the problem (Q4) …</p>
<p><strong>A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #8: The Lens of Problem Solving<br>To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to succeed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What problems does my game ask the player to solve?<br>● Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?<br>● How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #9: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad<br>To use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● Is my game design using elements of all four types?<br>● Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?<br>● Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?</p>
<p>Lens #10: The Lens of Holographic Design<br>To use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four elements and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate.<br>It is acceptable to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?<br>● What elements of the game detract from the experience?<br>● How can I change game elements to improve the experience?</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="Theme"><a href="#Theme" class="headerlink" title="Theme"></a>Theme</h5><blockquote><p>To write a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.<br>– Herman Melville</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unifying Themes<br>Step 1: Figure out what your theme is.<br>Step 2: Use every means possible to reinforce that theme.</p>
<p>Most game themes are experience-based, that is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #11: The Lens of Unification<br>● What is my theme?<br>● Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?<br>The Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Resonance</strong></p>
<p>But there is another kind of theme that can be just as resonant as an experience-based theme; sometimes more so. This is the truth-based theme.<br>Consider the movie Titanic … The main theme is not experience-based. Instead, it is a simple statement … “Love is more important than life, and stronger than death.”<br>This is a powerful statement. But it is a statement that many of us believe deeply in our heart of hearts. It is certainly not a scientific truth, but for many, it is a deeply held, though rarely expressed, personal truth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #12: The Lens of Resonance<br>To use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?<br>● When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?<br>● If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?<br>● I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?<br>The Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside ourselves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="Idea"><a href="#Idea" class="headerlink" title="Idea"></a>Idea</h5><p>“The secret is: don’t look to other jugglers for inspiration — look everywhere else”</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #13: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration<br>When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru. – Ram Dass<br>To use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games like it. Instead, look everywhere else.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?<br>● In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?<br>Using this lens requires an open mind and a big imagination. You need to search you feelings and observe everything around you. You must be willing to try the impossible — for surely it is impossible for a roll of the dice to capture the excitement of a swordfight, or for a videogame to make a player feel afraid of the dark — isn’t it? Use this lens to find the non-game experiences that will inspire your game. Your choices in the different quadrants of the tetrad (technology, mechanics, story, and aesthetics) can each be united by a single inspiration, or each can build on different inspirations, blending them together to create something entirely new. When you have concrete visions based on real life that guide your decision making, your experience will acquire an undeniable power, strength, and uniqueness. This lens works hand in hand with Lens #1: Essential Experience. Use the Lens of Infinite Inspiration to seek and find beautiful experiences, and the Lens of Essential Experience to bring them into your game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>State the Problem</strong><br><blockquote><p>People who come up with clever solutions are almost always the same people who take the time to figure out the real problem.<br>Three advantages of clearly stating your problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Broader creative space. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.</li>
<li>Clear measurement. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed ideas: How well do they solve the problem?</li>
<li>Better communication. When you are designing with a team, communication is much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has not been clearly stated.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #14: The Lens of the Problem Statement<br>To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?<br>● Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?<br>● Is a game really the best solution? Why?<br>● How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?<br>Defining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.</p>

<p><strong>The Eight Filters</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens # 15: The Lens of the Eight Filters<br>To use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must satisfy. You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all eight filters without requiring a change.<br>Ask yourself the eight key questions:<br>● Does this game feel right?<br>● Will the intended audience like this game enough?<br>● Is this a well-designed game?<br>● Is this game novel enough?<br>● Will this game sell?<br>● Is it technically possible to build this game?<br>● Does this game meet our social and community goals?<br>● Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?<br>In some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educational game will also have to answer questions like “Does this game teach what it is supposed to?” If your design requires more filters, don’t neglect them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Rule of the Loop</strong>: The more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be.<br><blockquote><p>● Loop Question 1: How can I make every loop count?<br>● Loop Question 2: How can I loop as fast as possible?</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>The Spiral Model, Barry Boehm, 1986</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a basic design.</li>
<li>Figure out the greatest risks in your design.</li>
<li>Build prototypes that mitigate those risks.</li>
<li>Test the prototypes.</li>
<li>Come up with a more detailed design based on what you have learned.</li>
<li>Return to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Mechanic might not be as fun as we think. </strong><br>Have a programmer make a very abstract version of this gameplay mechanic, with simple geometric shapes … You can probably have a working game in a week or two, and start answering questions about whether it is fun right away.</p>
<p><strong> (Technical limits) The game engine might not be able to handle XXX </strong><br>Build a quick prototype that does nothing but XXX, to see if the engine can handle it. This prototype has no gameplay; it is purely to test technical limits. If it can handle it, great! If it can’t, you can figure out a solution now, before any art has been generated. Again, this prototype will be a throwaway.</p>
<p><strong> Creating all the art assets might take more than we have </strong><br>Have an artist create one house and one animated character immediately to see how long it takes, and if it takes longer than you can afford, change your design immediately.</p>
<p><strong> We aren’t sure people will like our characters and story. </strong><br>An art prototype … Have your artists draw some concept art, or produce test renders of your characters and settings. Create some storyboards that show how the story progresses. Once you have these, start showing them to people (hopefully people in your target demographic) and gauge their reactions. Figure out what they like, don’t like, and why. Maybe they like the look of the main character, but hate his attitude. Maybe the villain is exciting, but the story is boring.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens # 16: The Lens of Risk Mitigation<br>To use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the things that could go horribly wrong with your game.<br>Ask yourself these questions:<br>● What could keep this game from being great?<br>● How can we stop that from happening?<br>Risk management is hard. It means you have to face up to the problems you would most like to avoid, and solve them immediately. But if you discipline yourself to do it, you’ll loop more times, and more usefully, and get a better game as a result. It is tempting to ignore potential problems and just work on the parts of your game you feel most confident about. You must resist this temptation and focus on the parts of your game that are in danger.</p>

The faster it can do that, the better … polishing your prototype may even make things worse. Playtesters (and colleagues) are more likely to point out problems with something that looks rough than with something that looks polished.</p>

One way is to use it on an existing game, to figure out how to add more toy-like qualities to it — that is, how to make it more approachable, and more fun to manipulate. But the second way, the braver way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have any idea what games will be played with them. This is risky if you are on a schedule — but if you are not, it can be a great “divining rod” to help you find wonderful games you might not have discovered otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Closing the Loop</strong></p>

<blockquote><p> Lens #18: The Lens of Passion<br>At the end of each prototype, when  you are carefully mitigating risks and planning what to do next, don’t forget to check how you feel about your game with these important questions:<br>● Am I filled with blinding passion about how great this game will be?<br>● If I’ve lost the passion, can I find it again?<br>● If the passion isn’t coming back, shouldn’t I be doing something else?<br>At the end of every sprint, when you are studying your prototypes and planning what to do next, you must remember to also do a “passion check.” Passion is the way your subconscious tells you that it is excited about your game. If the passion has gone away, something has gone wrong — if you can’t figure out what it is, it is very likely your game will be dead on arrival. Passion has its dangers — it is an irrational emotion, after all, but you must take it seriously, for more often than not, passion is what knocks down obstacles and carries a game to success.</p>

How can I change that?<br>● are my players bored because the game goes on too long? How can I change that?<br>● Would clocks or races make my gameplay more exciting?<br>● Time limits can irritate players.

Decisions are made based on information. Deciding the different attributes, their states, and who knows about them is core to the mechanics of your game. Small changes to who knows what infor- mation can radically change a game, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Who knows about what attributes can even change over the course of a game—a great way to create drama in your game is to make an important piece of private information suddenly become public.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #31: The Lens of Action<br>To use this lens, think about what your players can do and what they can’t and why. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the basic actions in my game?<br>● What are the strategic actions?<br>● What strategic actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in order to make those possible?<br>● am I happy with the ratio of strategic to basic actions?<br>● What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot? Can I somehow enable these, either as basic or strategic actions?<br>A game without actions is like a sentence without verbs—nothing happens. Deciding the actions in your game will be the most fundamental decision you can make as a game designer. Tiny changes to these actions will have tremendous ripple effects with the possibility of either creating marvelous emergent gameplay or making a game that is predictable and tedious. Choose your actions carefully, and learn to listen to your game and your players to learn what is made possible by your choices.</p>

<p>A game is not just defined by its rules, a game <strong>is</strong> its rules.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #33: The Lens of Rules<br>To use this lens, look deep into your game, until you can make out its most basic structure. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the operational rules?<br>● Are there “laws” or “house rules” that are forming as the game develops? Should these be incorporated into my game directly?<br>● Are there different modes in my game? Do these modes make things simpler, or more complex? Would the game be better with fewer modes? More modes?<br>● Who enforces the rules?<br>● Are the rules easy to understand, or is there confusion about them? If there is confusion, should I fix it by changing the rules or by explaining them more clearly?<br>There is a common misconception that designers make games by sitting down and writing a set of rules. This usually isn’t how it happens at all. a game’s rules are arrived at gradually and experimentally. The designer’s mind generally works in the domain of “operational rules,” occasionally switching to the perspective of “foundational rules” when thinking about how to change or improve the game. The “written rules” usually come toward the end, once the game is playable. Part of the designer’s job is to make sure there are rules that cover every circumstance. be sure to take careful notes as you playtest, because it is during these tests that holes in your rules will appear—if you just patch them quickly and don’t make a note, the same hole will just show up again later. a game is its rules—give them the time and consideration that they deserve.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #34: The Lens of Skill<br>To use this lens, stop looking at your game, and start looking at the skills you are asking of your players. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What skills does my game require from the player?<br>● Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?<br>● Which skills are dominant?<br>● Are these skills creating the experience I want?<br>● Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make the game feel unfair?<br>● Can players improve their skills with practice, leading to a feeling of mastery?<br>● Does this game demand the right level of skill?<br>Exercising skills can be a joyful thing—it is one of the reasons that people love games. Of course, it is only joyful if the skills are interesting and rewarding and if the challenge level strikes that ideal balance between “too easy” and “too hard.” Even dull skills (such as pushing buttons) can be made more interesting by dressing them up as virtual skills and providing the right level of challenge. Use this lens as a window into the experience the player is having. because skills do so much to define experience, the lens of Skill works quite well in conjunction with lens #2, Essential Experience.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #35: The Lens of Expected Value<br>To use this lens, think about the chance of different events occurring in your game and what those mean to your player. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?<br>● What is the perceived chance?<br>● What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quanti- fied? are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?<br>● Each action a player can take has a different expected value when I add up all the possible outcomes. am I happy with these values? Do they give the player interesting choices? are they too rewarding, or too punishing?</p>
<p>Expected value is one of your most valuable tools for analyzing game balance. The challenge of using it is finding a way to numerically represent everything that can happen to a player. Gaining and losing money is easy to represent. but what is the numerical value of “boots of speed” that let you run faster or a “warp gate” that lets you skip two levels? These are difficult to quantify perfectly—but that doesn’t mean you can’t take a guess. as we’ll see in the next chapter, as you go through multiple iterations of game testing and tweaking parameters and values in your game, you will also be tweaking your own estimations of the values of different outcomes. Quantifying these less tangible elements can be quite enlightening, because it makes you think concretely about what is valuable to the player and why—and this concrete knowledge will put you in control of the balance of your game.</p>

What parts just feel random?<br>● Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and challenge, or does it give them negative feelings of hopelessness and lack of control?<br>● Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?<br>● Do players have the opportunity to take interesting risks in the game?<br>● What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game? are there ways I can make random elements feel more like the exercise of a skill? are there ways I can make exercising skills feel more like risk taking?<br>Risk and randomness are like spices. a game without any hint of them can be completely bland, but put in too much and they overwhelm everything else. but get them just right, and they bring out the flavor of everything else in your game. Unfortunately, using them in your game is not as simple as sprinkling them on top. You must look into your game to see where elements of risk and randomness naturally arise, and then decide how you can best tame them to do your bidding. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that elements of chance only occur around die rolls or randomly generated numbers.

Taking into account each player’s skill level, find a way to give each player a chance of winning that each will consider to be fair.<br>ask yourself these questions:<br>● Should my game be symmetrical? Why?<br>● Should my game be asymmetrical? Why?<br>● Which is more important: that my game is a reliable measure of who has the most skill or that it provide an interesting challenge to all players?<br>● If I want players of different skill levels to play together, what means will I use to make the game interesting and challenging for everyone?<br>Fairness can be a slippery subject. There are some cases where one side has an advantage over the other and the game still seems fair. Sometimes this is so that players of unequal skill can play together, but there can be other reasons. In the game Alien vs. Predator, for example, it is generally recognized that in multiplayer mode, Predators have a significant advantage over the aliens. Players do not consider it to be unfair, however, because it is in keeping with the Alien vs. Predator story world, and they accept that if they play as an alien, they will be at a disadvantage and will need to compensate for that with extra skill. It is a badge of pride among players to be able to win the game when playing as an alien.</p>

Use this lens to decide whether they are balanced properly in your game. ask these questions:<br>● If “1” is competition and “10” is cooperation, what number should my game get?<br>● Can I give players a choice whether to play cooperatively or competitively?<br>● Does my audience prefer competition, cooperation, or a mix?<br>● Is team competition something that makes sense for my game? Is my game more fun with team competition or with solo competition?</p>

</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #46: The Lens of Reward<br>Everyone likes to be told they are doing a good job. ask these questions to determine if your game is giving out the right rewards in the right amounts at the right times:<br>● What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?<br>● Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored by them? Why?<br>● Getting a reward you don’t understand is like getting no reward at all. Do my players understand the rewards they are getting?<br>● Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a more variable way?<br>● How are my rewards related to one another? Is there a way that they could be better connected?<br>● How are my rewards building? Too fast, too slow, or just right?<br>Balancing rewards is different for every game. Not only does a designer have to worry about giving out the right ones, but he have to worry about giving them at the right times in the right amounts. This can only be determined through trial and error—even then, it probably won’t be right for everyone. When trying to balance rewards, it is hard to be perfect—you often have to settle for “good enough.”</p>

<p><strong>Punishment</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>…One way to remove powers fairly is to take them away temporarily…<br>…reward is always a better tool for reinforcement than punishment…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #47: The Lens of Punishment<br>Punishment must be used delicately, since after all, players are in a game of their own free will. balanced appropriately, it will give everything in your game more meaning, and players will have a real sense of pride when they succeed at your game. To examine the punishment in your game, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the punishments in my game?<br>● Why am I punishing the players? What do I hope to achieve by it?<br>● Do my punishments seem fair to the players? Why or why not?<br>● Is there a way to turn these punishments into rewards and get the same or a better effect?<br>● Are my strong punishments balanced against commensurately strong rewards?</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #48: The Lens of Simplicity/Complexity<br>Striking the right balance between simplicity and complexity is difficult and must be done for the right reasons. Use this lens to help your game become one in which meaningful complexity arises out of a simple system. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What elements of innate complexity do I have in my game?<br>● Is there a way this innate complexity could be turned into emergent complexity?<br>● Do elements of emergent complexity arise from my game? If not, why not?<br>● Are there elements of my game that are too simple?</p>

<blockquote><p>There is an old Hollywood rule of thumb: if a line in a script doesn’t serve at least two purposes, it should be cut.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #49: The Lens of Elegance<br>Most “classic games” are considered to be masterpieces of elegance. Use this lens to make your game as elegant as possible. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the elements of my game?<br>● What are the purposes of each element? Count these up to give the element an “elegance rating.”<br>● For elements with only one or two purposes, can some of these be combined into each other or removed altogether?<br>● For elements with several purposes, is it possible for them to take on even more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Character</strong><br><blockquote><p>Lens #50: The Lens of Character<br>Elegance and character are opposites. They are like miniature versions of simplicity and complexity and must be kept in balance. To make sure your game has lovable, defining quirks, ask yourself these questions:<br>● Is there anything strange in my game that players talk about excitedly?<br>● Does my game have funny qualities that make it unique?<br>● Does my game have flaws that players like?</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Detail and Imagination</strong><br><blockquote><p>● Only detail what you can do well: …use subtitles…the player’s imagination will fill in a voice…this idea goes for scenery, sfx, characters, animations…if you can’t do it well, try to find a way to leave it to the player’s imagination.<br>● Give details the imagination can use<br>● Familiar worlds do not need much detail<br>● Use the binocular effect: …filling in the close-ups on the tiny distant figures<br>● Give details that inspire imagination: …it is a fantasy—it only has to be tied to reality by a thin thread…</p>
</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #51: The Lens of Imagination<br>All games have some element of imagination and some element of connection to reality. Use this lens to help find the balance between detail and imagination. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What must the player understand to play my game?<br>● Can some element of imagination help them understand that better?<br>● What high-quality, realistic details can we provide in this game?<br>● What details would be low quality if we provided them? Can imagination fill the gap instead?<br>● Can I give details that the imagination will be able to reuse again and again?<br>● What details I provide inspire imagination?<br>● What details I provide stifle imagination?</p>

</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #52: The Lens of Economy<br>Giving a game an economy can give it surprising depth and a life all its own. But like all living things, it can be difficult to control. Use this lens to keep your economy in balance:<br>● How can my players earn money? Should there be other ways?<br>● What can my players buy? Why?<br>● Is money too easy to get? Too hard? How can I change this?<br>● Are choices about earning and spending meaningful ones?<br>● Is a universal currency a good idea in my game, or should there be specialized currencies?</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #53: The Lens of Balance<br>There are many types of game balance, and each is important. However, it is easy to get lost in the details and forget the big picture. Use this simple lens to get out of the mire, and ask yourself the only important question:<br>● Does my game feel right? Why or why not?</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #54: The Lens of Accessibility<br>When you present a puzzle to players (or a game of any kind), they should be able to clearly visualize what their first few steps would be. ask yourself these questions:<br>● How will players know how to begin solving my puzzle or playing my game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?<br>● Does my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before? If it does, how can I draw attention to that similarity. If it does not, how can I make them understand how it does behave?<br>● Does my puzzle or game draw people in and make them want to touch it and manipulate it? If not, how I can I change it so that it does?</p>

<p>Game of Twenty Questions<br>Visible progress is the primary driver of mood in the workplace.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #55: The Lens of Visible Progress<br>Players need to see that they are making progress when solving a difficult problem. To make sure they are getting this feedback, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What does it mean to make progress in my game or puzzle?<br>● Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?<br>● What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?</p>

To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:<br>● are there bottlenecks in my design where players are unable to proceed if they cannot solve a particular challenge? If so, can I add parallel challenges for a player to work on when this challenge stumps them?<br>● If parallel challenges are too similar, the parallelism offers little benefit. are my parallel challenges different enough from each other to give players the benefit of variety?<br>● Can my parallel challenges be connected somehow? Is there a way that making progress on one can make it easier to solve the others?</p>
</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #57: The Lens of the Pyramid<br>Pyramids fascinate us because they have a singular highest point. To give your puzzle the allure of the ancient pyramids, ask yourself these questions:<br>● Is there a way all the pieces of my puzzle can feed into a singular challenge at the end?<br>● Big pyramids are often made of little pyramids—can I have a hierarchy of ever more challenging puzzle elements, gradually leading to a final challenge?<br>● Is the challenge at the top of my pyramid interesting, compelling, and clear? Does it make people want to work in order to get to it?</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #58: The Lens of the Puzzle<br>Puzzles make the player stop and think. To ensure your puzzles are doing everything you want to shape the player experience, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the puzzles in my game?<br>● Should I have more puzzles, or less? Why?<br>● Which of the ten puzzle principles apply to each of my puzzles?<br>● Do I have any incongruous puzzles? How can I better integrate them into the game? (Use lens #49, Elegance, to help do this).<br>In the last few chapters, we have focused on game internals—it is now time to<br>consider an external element, the interface of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="Interface"><a href="#Interface" class="headerlink" title="Interface"></a>Interface</h5><p>The goal of an interface is to make players feel in control of their experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #59: The Lens of Control<br>This lens has uses beyond just examining your interface, since meaningful control is essential for immersive interactivity. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:<br>● When players use the interface, does it do what is expected? If not, why not?<br>● Intuitive interfaces give a feeling of control. Is your interface easy to master or hard to master?<br>● Do your players feel they have a strong influence over the outcome of the game? If not, how can you change that?<br>● feeling powerful = feeling in control. Do your players feel powerful? Can you make them feel more powerful somehow?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #60: The Lens of Physical Interface<br>Somehow, the player has a physical interaction with your game. Copying existing physical interfaces is an easy trap to fall into. Use this lens to be sure that your physical interface is well suited to your game by asking these questions:<br>● What does the player pick up and touch? Can this be made more pleasing?<br>● How does this map to the actions in the game world? Can the mapping be more direct?<br>● If you can’t create a custom physical interface, what metaphor are you using when you map the inputs to the game world?<br>● How does the physical interface look under the lens of the Toy?<br>● How does the player see, hear, and touch the world of the game? Is there a way to include a physical output device that will make the world become more real in the player’s imagination?<br>The world of videogames occasionally goes through dry spells where designers feel it is not feasible to create custom physical interfaces. but the marketplace thrives on experimentation and novelty, and suddenly specially crafted physical interfaces, like the Dance Dance Revolution mat, the Guitar Hero guitar, and the Wiimote appear bringing new life to old gameplay by giving players a new way to interact with old game mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #61: The Lens of Virtual Interface<br>Designing virtual interfaces can be very tricky. Done poorly, they become a wall between the player and the game world. Done well, they amplify the power and control a player has in the game world. ask these questions to make sure that your virtual interface is enhancing player experience as much as possible:<br>● What information does a player need to receive that isn’t obvious just by looking at the game world?<br>● When does the player need this information? all the time? Only occasionally? Only at the end of a level?<br>● How can this information be delivered to the player in a way that won’t interfere with the player’s interactions with the game world?<br>● Are there elements of the game world that are easier to interact with using<br>a Virtual interface (like a pop-up menu, for instance) than they are to interact with directly?<br>● What kind of virtual interface is best suited to my physical interface? Pop-up menus, for example, are a poor match for a gamepad controller.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #62: The Lens of Transparency<br>No matter how beautiful your interface is, it would be better if there were less of it. —Edward Tufte<br>The ideal interface becomes invisible to the player letting the player’s imagination be completely immersed in the game world. To ensure invisibility, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the player’s desires? Does the interface let the players do what they want?<br>● Is the interface simple enough that with practice, players will be able to use it without thinking?<br>● Do new players find the interface intuitive? If not, can it be made more intuitive, somehow? Would allowing players to customize the controls help or hurt?</p>

<p><strong>feedback</strong>: one example is the net on a basketball hoop…does not affect the gameplay at all—but it slows the ball as it descends from the hoop so all players can clearly see that it went in…</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #63: The Lens of Feedback<br>The feedback a player gets from the game is many things: judgment, reward, instruction, encouragement, and challenge. Use this lens to be sure your feedback loop is creating the experience you want by asking these questions at every moment in your game:<br>● What do players need to know at this moment?<br>● What do players want to know at this moment?<br>● What do you want players to feel at this moment? How can you give feedback that creates that feeling?<br>● What do the players want to feel at this moment? Is there an opportunity for them to create a situation where they will feel that?<br>● What is the player’s goal at this moment? What feedback will help them toward that goal?</p>

<p><strong>second-order motion</strong>: motion that is derived from the action of the player.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #64: The Lens of Juiciness<br>To call an interface “juicy” might seem kind of silly—although it is very common to hear an interface with very little feedback described as “dry.” Juicy interfaces are fun the moment you pick them up. To maximize juiciness, ask yourself these questions:<br>● Is my interface giving the player continuous feedback for their actions? If not, why not?<br>● Is second-order motion created by the actions of the player? Is this motion powerful and interesting?<br>● Juicy systems reward the player many ways at once. When I give the player a reward, how many ways am I simultaneously rewarding them? Can I find more ways?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #65: The Lens of Primality<br>Some actions and interfaces are so intuitive that animals were doing them hundreds of millions of years ago. To capture the power of primality, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What parts of my game are so primal an animal could play? Why?<br>● What parts of my game could be more primal?</p>

</ol>
<blockquote><p>Lens #66: The Lens of Channels and Dimensions<br>Choosing how to map game information to channels and dimensions is the heart of designing your game interface. Use this lens to make sure you do it thoughtfully and well. ask yourself these questions:<br>● What data need to travel to and from the player?<br>● Which data are most important?<br>● What channels do I have available to transmit these data?<br>● Which channels are most appropriate for which data? Why?<br>● Which dimensions are available on the different channels?<br>● How should I use those dimensions?</p>

<p><strong>Modes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use as few modes as possible</li>
<li>Make different modes look as different as possible</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Lens #67: The Lens of Modes<br>An interface of any complexity is going to require modes. To make sure your modes make the player feel powerful and in control and do not confuse or overwhelm, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What modes do I need in my game? Why?<br>● Can any modes be collapsed or combined?<br>● Are any of the modes overlapping? If so, can I put them on different input channels?<br>● When the game changes modes, how does the player know that? Can the game communicate the mode change in more than one way?</p>

<blockquote><p>Lens #68: The Lens of Moments<br>Memorable moments are stars that make up the constellation of your interest curve. To chart what is most important, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the key moments in my game?<br>● How can I make each moment as powerful as possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #69: The Lens of the Interest Curve<br>Exactly what captivates the human mind often seems different for every person, but the most pleasurable patterns of that captivation are remarkably similar for everyone. To see how a player’s interest in your experience changes over time, ask yourself these questions:<br>● If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it generally shaped?<br>● Does it have a hook?<br>● Does it have gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?<br>● Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?<br>● What changes would give me a better interest curve?<br>● Is there a fractal structure to my interest curve? Should there be?<br>● Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask playtesters to draw an interest curve, what does it look like?<br>Since all players are different, you may find it quite useful to use the lens of the Interest Curve and lens #19, The Player, at the same time, creating a unique interest curve for each of the types of players your game is trying to reach.</p>

<p><strong>Interpersonal Circumplex</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lens #88: The Lens of the Interpersonal Circumplex<br>Understanding the relationships between your characters is crucial. One way to do this is to create a graph with one axis labeled hostile/friendly and the other labeled submissive/dominant. Pick a character to analyze, and put them in the middle. Plot out where other characters lie relative to that character, and ask yourself these questions:<br>● are there any gaps in the chart? Why are they there? Would it be better if the gaps were filled?<br>● are there “extreme characters” on the graph? If not, would it be better if there were?<br>● are the character’s friends in the same quadrant, or different quadrants? What if that were different?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #89: The Lens of the Character Web<br>To flesh out your characters’ relationships better, make a list of all your char- acters, and ask yourself these questions:<br>● How, specifically, does each character feel about each of the others?<br>● are there any connections unaccounted for? How can I use those?<br>● are there too many similar connections? How can they be more different?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #90: The Lens of Status<br>When people interact, they take on different behaviors depending on their status levels. To make your characters more aware of each other, ask yourself these questions:<br>● What are the relative status levels of the characters in my game?<br>● How can they show appropriate status behaviors?<br>● Conflicts of status are interesting—how are my characters vying for status?<br>● Changes of status are interesting—where do they happen in my game?<br>● How am I giving the player a chance to express status?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lens #91: The Lens of Character Transformation<br>We pay attention to character transformation, because we care about what might change us. To ensure your characters are transforming in interesting ways, ask yourself these questions:<br>● How does each of my characters change throughout the game?<br>● How am I communicating those changes to the player? Can I communicate them more clearly, or more strongly?<br>● Is there enough change?<br>● are the changes surprising and interesting?<br>● are the changes believable?</p>

<p>赞同作者贯穿本书的一个观点：游戏的目的是学习<br>我之前也有相同的想法，所以看到ToF之后有种同道的感觉。Raph对于游戏的寄望是纯粹的，令人敬仰，但这种纯粹其实是我不同意的。<br>人性既然如此，如何在这客观条件下引导，达成学到东西这一目的，才是设计者(教育者)应当做的。<br>我同意游戏的目的是使玩家挑战自己并不断学习，但我同时认为给人带来快乐也是游戏的目的，<br>作为引导学习的更好的方式，也许是 <strong>在快乐的游戏中学习</strong></p>
<p>Basically, game designers suffer from what I call “designeritis.” They build up encyclopedic recollections of games past and present, and they then theoretically use these to make new games.<br>其实能从过往抽象出一些经验，这个未必不正确，比如如果对技术和美术了解的情况下，对于可行性判断乃至整个设计都会很有帮助。</p>
<p>The most creative and fertile game designers working today tend to be the ones who make a point of not focusing too much on other games for inspiration.<br>即游戏设计者要广涉猎，比如电影，漫画，小说，以及其它很多事物</p>
<h3 id="Games-in-Context"><a href="#Games-in-Context" class="headerlink" title="Games in Context"></a>Games in Context</h3><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">UserGoal		[ Constructive, Experiential, Destructive ]</div><div class="line">Interaction 	[ Collaborative, Competitive, Solo ]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Modding is just playing the game in another way<br>我最近也在想这个，比如做M&amp;B或者Paradox的历史游戏的Mod，再或者Domiions的Mod，的时候，确实非常有趣，不亚于玩游戏本身。</p>
<p>The chills are not always enjoyable…engaging in interaction with games need not be fun, either, but might indeed be fulfilling, thought-provoking, challenging, and also difficult, painful, and even compulsive.<br>并不仅有快乐使人觉得一款游戏好</p>
<p>Mere entertainment becomes art when the communicative element in the work is either novel or exceptionally well done.<br>The analogy for a game would be one you can replay over and over again, and still discover new things.<br>Choosing constraints is one of the most fruitful ways to creativity.</p>
<p>Entertainment and Art<br>若以学习为目的，则应靠向Entertainment，但游戏本身则不受这限制，二者皆可。</p>
<h3 id="The-Ethics-of-Entertainment"><a href="#The-Ethics-of-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="The Ethics of Entertainment"></a>The Ethics of Entertainment</h3><p>画面、音效等等也是用户体验的一部分，也非常重要</p>
<p>The constructive thing to do is to push the boundary gently so that it doesn’t backfire. That’s how we got Lolita, Catcher in the Rye, and Apocalypse Now.</p>
<h3 id="Where-Games-Should-Go"><a href="#Where-Games-Should-Go" class="headerlink" title="Where Games Should Go"></a>Where Games Should Go</h3><p>Mastery of the medium of games will have to imply authorial intent. The formal systems must be capable of invoking desired learning patterns.<br>If they can’t, then games are a second-rate art form, and always will be.</p>
<h3 id="Taking-Their-Rightful-Place"><a href="#Taking-Their-Rightful-Place" class="headerlink" title="Taking Their Rightful Place"></a>Taking Their Rightful Place</h3><p>…games do need to illuminate aspects of ourselves that we do not understand fully.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">The gap between those who want games to entertain and those who want games to be art does not exist.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Art and entertainment are not terms of <strong>type</strong> — they are terms of <strong>intensity</strong>.</p>

<p>如果大部分人喜欢轻松的娱乐，而轻松娱乐与有突破性相抵，则对大多数人来说寓教于乐为不可能。<br>似乎并非如此，权力的游戏可能就是一个例外，吉卜力的作品可能大部都是例外。<br>还是要明确目的，掌控方法。<br>寓教于乐，最差的情况下，只要比现行教科书生动有趣，就是一种进步。</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Popular ... is largely an accident of history</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But after ten years, I look back on it all and I see games as not just a swirl of systems,<br>but as a space between the dust from which we come and the dust we shall be,<br>a space in which we can engage in that grand pursuit of happiness.<br>```</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><strong>- 允许生成shader的变种通常称为 “mega shaders” 或 “uber shaders”</strong></p>
<p><strong>- 变种数量是指数级增长的</strong><br>如<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">#pragma multi_compile A B C</div><div class="line">#pragma multi_compile D E</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>

<p><strong>- multi_compile 和 shader_feature 的区别</strong></p>
<p>未使用的shader_feature不会build。</p>
<p>所以对于我们运行时控制渲染的要求：</p>
<ol>
<li>用shader_feature，只要build时把能用到的feature全开就好（更通用）</li>
<li>用multi_compile（更安全）</li>
</ol>

<p>在这种做法下头发UV需要沿着Shift贴图的方向（一般是上下）来摆放，如果不想必须如此，则可以用守望先锋的做法。</p>

<p>经过试验，这张贴图应该是记录了Tangent的。<br>因为有这张贴图，守望的头发UV就可以随意摆放而不受限制了。</p>
<p>然而似乎用一个uv1也可以解决……还需要再学习</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Another Workflow from Phtoshop to Unity]]></title>
      <url>/2014/07/31/20140731-PhotoshopUnityPipeline/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近我们需要把一些Photoshop做的2D素材导入Unity。如果用传统方式一张一张的导，然后在Unity里再拼起来的话，会非常费时费力。好在这个过程是可以自动化的。</p>
<p>一种方法是在Unity端全部解决。SwingSwingSubmarine 的 Ben 写的 From Photoshop to Unity 描述了这种方法，使用了一个第三方的可以处理Photoshop文件的Library：PsdPlugin. 这种方法的问题是项目文件夹下需要保存psd文件，然后psd文件可能比较大，版本控制会有点麻烦。</p>
<p>Unity官方博客曾经发过一套方法: A good workflow to smoothly import 2D content into Unity, Part I 和 Part II，作者是 Brett Bibby。 这个方法中，输出图片素材由Photoshop完成，导入和重建场景由Unity完成，这不但是一个更自然的方法，也是一个更模块化的方法，谁也不用知道对方领域里的东西。但是原版方法要求事先合成一个图层才能输出。</p>
<p>所以这篇博客描述一种尽量符合美术工作习惯，能够从原版工作文档直接输出的方法。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Recently we need to transfer a large amount of 2D assets from Photoshop to Unity, then reproduce the positions etc. which is already in Photoshop. It would cost a lot of of time if we do this manually, fortunately we don’t have to, because this process can be automated.</p>
<p>A recent approach is From Photoshop to Unity written by Ben of SwingSwingSubmarine. It is a pure Unity-side solution where examine Photoshop file (psd) is also completed inside Unity via a third-party library PsdPlugin. Thus the project have to keep large psd files within Unity’s folder and caused some inconvenience for version control.</p>
<p>Another approach is: A good workflow to smoothly import 2D content into Unity, Part I and Part II by Brett Bibby. The images are exported inside Photoshop via Adobe Extend scripts, their positions are recorded in a xml file, then use a customized Unity Editor script to import these assets. This seems to be the most flexible and robust process. However this script is layer-based which still requires the artist to combine layers before export. </p>
<p>The process should take place on a ‘working psd’ which doesn’t require the artist to manually change anything before exporting. So here a improved version is described in this blog post.</p>

<p>Recently when trying to make a Unity terrain I found it cost dozens of drawcalls, definitely no go for mobile platform. So I wrote a shader that can do multi-texture tilling on a single mesh, as well as Multi-UV Mixing, credit goes to this post by larsbertram1. you can find the shader file at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>Multi-UV Mixing, in plain words, is to scale the texture and mix back onto itself, it is a low-cost method to reduce apparent tilling.</p>

<p>The environment in the Character Customization Scene of TWD is not 3D, it is just only one image (above) pre-rendered by Blender.</p>
<p>But when we put an actual 3D character in Unity, we what it looks as she/he is standing in the 3D movie studio. How? We do Camera Mapping.</p>
<p>First, create a new Camera in Unity and copy the position and rotation of the Blender camera. We can do this because: Blender’s unit  =  Unity’s unit  =  1 meter.<br>Careful about the rotation though, Blenders’ up is Z while in Unity it’s Y.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20180606163955.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now for the field of view, we can’t use the same field of view on both camera. You may noticed I used 16mm focal length (that’s 90° FOV on 32mm full frame format sensor) for the Blender camera, but clearly 90° doesn’t match. So export part of the studio, import them into Unity and put them where they were, then drag the “Field of View” slider in Unity’s camera inspector until the objects match the background image, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20180606164244.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And that is it. Now wherever we put a 3D object in the scene (as long as it’s position.y == 0), it will looks like on the ground of that movie studio.</p>
<p><img src="/img/296966138_orig.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>PS: one last thing, Photoshop’s “Filter -&gt; Blur -&gt; Iris Blur” was used for the background image.</p>

<p>昨儿做UI的时候想起来，之前搞角色定制找资料挺费劲的，很多东西都不知道啥是啥。Unity的例子帮了大忙，但还是会有  “啥玩意儿啊”， 这种感觉。所以想着把自己的经验在这分享一下。</p>
<p>代码在最下面。</p>
<p>Yesterday I rearranged UI of character customization scene of the under-developing-but-open-for-testing game <the working="" dead="">. </the></p>
<p>And I remembered that, back to a few month ago it was a hard time for me to get information about how to achieve Character Customization. Unity’s example, and the community helped a lot. But I still spent hours to figure out what is what.</p>
<p>So I think I should share my experience here. Hope this can help others who were like me. You can download the source file at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>俺的模型啥的是用Blender做的。直接用 Unity的例子 的模型也行，都一样。</p>
<p>Before we start, I’ve created these assets in Blender. You can create your own, or simply use assets from Unity’s example, the fundamentals are same.</p>

<p>I linked all my assets in to a GameObject, used a byte[] to specify which parts the player have chosen (called ‘config’).</p>
<p>Now just set up the UI and let the player customize his/her character.</p>

<p>SkinnedMesh 就是关联骨骼的mesh，哪个vertex受哪根骨头影响百分之多少，然后骨头一动皮也就跟着动了。每一个部件都是一个SkinnedMesh，但是这东西很费，很影响性能，所以越少越好。一般一个角色内的SkinnedMesh要把它们合起来。</p>
<p>骨头：在Unity里就是Transform</p>
<p>Skinned Meshes are meshes linked with ‘Bones’, Each bone is associated with some vertices of the mesh (with different weights). During animation, the skinned mesh is deformed ( I’ve read somewhere that new mesh are generated for each frame, heavy, so heavy ).</p>
<p>So in short, skinned meshes kill performance, and we definitely want less of them in the scene if possible.<br>Yes, we should combine them.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering what are Bones, they are just Transforms in Unity.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20180606163138.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>用下面的代码，根据之前玩家选择的配置，把各个部件粘起来。</p>
<p>In the last Section, we have a byte[] config chosen by the player, now we are going to build a character with single mesh using this config, </p>
<p>and here is the function to do this:</p>
